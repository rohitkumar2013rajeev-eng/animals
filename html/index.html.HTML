<P style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;line-height: 32px;margin-bottom: 50px;">Animals are living beings that play an important role in nature and in our lives.<br> They are found all over the world, from forests and oceans to deserts and mountains. Some animals are wild and live in natural habitats, while others are domestic and live with humans. They provide us with food, transport, and companionship. Animals also help maintain balance in the environment by being part of the food chain. We must take care of animals and protect them, because they too are an important part of life on Earth.</p>
